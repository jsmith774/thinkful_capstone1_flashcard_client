        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
          This project is an online flashcard app. It is an electronic version
          of traditional physical flashcards commonly used in classrooms.
          Whereas traditional flashcards required a teacher and a student/class
          to be in physical proximity in a face-to-face environment, this
          application removes the physical proximity constraint. The application
          provides a familiar flashcard format that can be utilized remotely and
          lends itself to distance learning environments. This initial "Minimum
          Viable Product" release will allow students to drill/self-assess
          during the formative learning stage. A future enhancement is to add a
          summative assessment mode that Educators can use to test/grade
          Students
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two primary User Roles in the system. A user may be an
          Educator or a Student. Students/Educators will NOT self-register.
          Students and Educator accounts will be pre-loaded.
        </p>
        <p>
          For initial release, flashcards will also be pre-loaded. This initial
          MVP version of the application will focus on the creation of Decks,
          adding select cards to the deck, and granting deck access to select
          student users.
        </p>
